Welcome to The Atlas
Inn!

This is an Inn built mainly for new players to have a spot where to safely store their stuff while they figure out how this server works, and what they want to do. Like everywhere there's rules and stuff to know:
1. For being a resident of The Atlas, there is a daily tax of 10$ a day (daily quests give you 500$)

2. You'll have one room, but you can at any time move out to any other town, create your own, or even buy and own your plot here (more in the next book)3. There is a community farm heading downtown with various crops for basic food on the lowest floor (replant or else). There is a nation shop in Evermore where you can buy materials.
Make sure to interact with your nation/town members :>

4, If you go offline for a month (as an Inn resident) i will store your stuff in a private chest  indefinetly. If you come back your stuff will be waiting you there at the attic of the Scouting Guild, in chests to your name and only you will be able to open them.

Remember that you can tp back here with /t spawn

You can also check out higher ranks with /ranks to get useful QoL commands (and a backpack)

The town itself is always in expansion, Atlas is forever growing!
That's about it, if you have any questions most people in the server are up to help but if it's something specifically related to The Atlas town and I'm not online, you can search for me in the PirateSoftware discord server (same username as here, Mr.Escudero)
