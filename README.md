===================
   -Getting Started-
===================
Begin your quest by visiting Midgard. In the town of Origin, make sure to acquaint yourself with the locals. Tools and gear are not made the traditional way in this world and require the help of townsfolk to create them. The craftsmen who stick to their stations around town will generally be the ones to create tools and other things. Keeping track of these recipes can be tough, but we'll get to that. When you start adventuring, you'll quickly notice a lot of "EXP Acquired" messages in chat.
For a way to remove these messages, easily keep track of recipes improving your experience as a whole, read the next section.








===================
   -Playing Vanilla?-
===================
Hey! Are you playing in Vanilla Minecraft? Tired of XP being spammed in chat? Want a better way to keep track of recipes?

I've put up a modpack containing only the essential mods for an improved BlockGame
experience. All of the mods in this package are blockgame friendly and don't provide any advantages over other players.

>BlockGame Essentials
You can find this modpack by going to the Pirate Software discord and searching "cheddargt modpack".
This is the easiest way to set up the mods "BlockGame Enhanced" and "BlockGame Journal", the two most important ones IMO. 

To learn more about these, as well as all of the other mods included in this modpack, the topic on discord contains all the info you need.
These are all safe to use and once you install the modpack, you can always add/remove mods as you please! If you're in doubt on whether a mod is allowed or not, ask in the discord section "#blockgame-modders" and we will promptly clear your doubts!

===================
     -The Realms-
===================
There are three realms in BlockGame: Yggdrasil, Midgard and Myrkheim.

>Yggdrasil
This is the 'Realm between Realms', kind of like a hub/ overworld.


>Midgard
This is where towns, the bazaar, market and other 'permanent' structures are located. If you go to '/warp Yggdrasil' and walk into Midgard, you'll find yourself in Origin.

Origin is the main city of BlockGame. It's where you'll find
your personal Ender Chest, the craftsmen and everyone else responsible for Professions.
PVP is enabled in most towns aside from Origin, but it's very rare to get into a fight and will likely get you into trouble with that town's Mayor if you do.

>Myrkheim
This is the wilderness. PVP is Enabled. Go to Myrkheim to explore, gather materials but don't get attached: this realm is destroyed and regenerated once a week.
You can only return from Myrkheim through a Nether Portal.
The compass in your 
inventory always points to 'Myrkheim Extraction' (0,0), which contains Nether Portals that take you back to Midgard.

If you lose your compass or any other starter items, you can purchase a starter kit from Forge, a craftsmen in Origin.

===================
   -Important Stuff-
===================
BlockGame has a lot of mechanics that are different from base Minecraft that you should be aware of, so read carefully!

>Nether Portals
When you take a Nether Portal in Myrkheim, you'll be
teleported to Origin. If you go through any Nether Portal in Midgard (except the one in Origin - inside the Town Hall), you'll be teleported back to the same portal you took in Myrkheim, unless you die. If you die, you’ll have to walk back from the start. Taking the portal in Origin will not only
take you to the start of Myrkheim, but also reset your “last portal” location, so be careful!

>Hunger
Though hunger is in vanilla Minecraft, BlockGame makes eating more rewarding and punishing to keep up on. Failing to feed yourself will inevitably 
result in your death so make sure to have some snacks ready! 

On the flipside, being fully fed will give you a small buff, improving your EXP gain and movement speed while fully fed. However, just eating normal foods won't keep you fed for long, which is why you need to
worry about Hydration as well.

>Hydration
Hydration is basically a second hunger bar on top of your normal hunger bar. Thirst will deplete before hunger, allowing you to keep your fully fed buff longer. To drink water in BlockGame, you need to fill an
empty glass bottle with water from a cauldron. This is so important that I (cheddar) made a tutorial on youtube showing a quick way to do this on-the-go - 'How to drink water in BlockGame'. Yes, really.

>Towns
You can visit public towns by typing
"/t spawn town_name".
In order to get a town you can either create
your own or join an existing town. I highly suggest you get a room at The Atlas Inn.

It has rooms for rental and it is very newbie friendly! You can read more about it in the "The Atlas Inn" section in p77.
===================
     -Storage 101-
===================
In the beggining of your journey, storage is very limited. Keeping items on yourself is dangerous as some items are cursed with Butterfingers, meaning they drop upon death. You can avoid this by storing these items
in Satchels or in your Backpack (read below).

>Ender Chest
This is your own personal storage located outside the Town Hall in Origin. You can safely store items there knowing that no one else will be able to access it.

>Satchels
Satchels can hold up to 64 anything. Stuff stored inside satchels will not drop upon death, so having one or two to store your loot/essences as you explore is very useful.

>Bank
You can store money on-the-go by using
the /deposit command. Use this to avoid losing your money due to unpredictable deaths.

>Backpack
The Backpack can be automatically acquired by reaching the [Peasant] rank. It's a personal, extra inventory area that can be accessed
anywhere by using the /backpack command. Stuff stored inside your Backpack will also not drop upon death.

Use /ranks to buy ranks in order to get your Backpack as fast as you can!



===================
     -Helpful Tips-
===================

>Focus on Mining
Mining is probably the single most important way of getting things in BlockGame. Leveling up your Mining tools as fast as possible will allow you to get more materials than any other skill. 
Right off the start, focus on getting a Brass Pickaxe so you can mine Iron.

>Don't use Coal
Coal is an important resource for crafting gear. Use Dried Kelp Blocks instead. Can be crafted by placing 9 Kelp in a crafting bench.

>Survive in Myrkheim
One strategy I've found to be very for surviving Myrkheim is to go as far away as you can, >>saving your coordinates<<, digging a hole straight down, covering the entrance with dirt so no one suspects a thing and building a small little settlement for yourself. This
includes a few chests to keep nothing of value (materials, dirt, cobblestone etc), a water cauldron to stay hydrated and a Nether Portal so you can quickly sell stuff, store valuables in in your Ender Chest, etc.

>Spec into Magic as soon as possible.
Magic skills are very
powerful and having a ranged attack is important. If you'd like an advice, The Atlas Inn is a great place for a sip of water ;)

>Use Community Farms
The farms in Origin are for everyone to use! They're useful for getting food easily. Take whatever you need, but make
sure to replant! The 'Shopping Cart Theory' states that an "individual's moral character can be determined by whether they choose to return a shopping cart to its designated spot after use, or whether they simply leave it wherever it suits them". Replanting after
harvesting is 
BlockGame's equivalent of that theory.

>Craft items/armor
Armors and offhand items improve the stats and exp gain of the profession that they're for. The higher your profession skill, higher are the odds
of obtaining rare drops, including essences! 

>Get a bucket!
You can only leave Myrkheim through nether portals! Therefore having a
way to make a portal as fast as possible is important. You can make a Nether portal by using a bucket,
water and lava. Simply use the lava to shape your portal and place them next to lava. If you find any lava pools laying around in Myrk, you can make yourself a quick portal to go to Origin and back, but be careful: leaving portals out in the open is prone to them getting broken or lava
way to make a portal as fast as possible is important. You can make a Nether portal by having two buckets: one containing water and the other one for placing the lava. If you find any lava pools laying around in Myrk, you can make yourself a quick portal to go to Origin and back, but be
careful: leaving portals out in the open is prone to them getting broken or lava casted. 

>Talk to others.
Blockgame is a Social Sandbox MMO, so one of the most important parts is being social! Don't be afraid to ask for help in whatever way you need.
===================
  -Materials & Items-
===================
While looking at the crafting recipes from the townspeople of Origin, you may have noticed that they need some materials that aren't in vanilla Minecraft. But where do you get these?

Allow us to explain...
>Pristine Stone
Can ge gathered by mining stone-like objects and looting chests. It's used for a lot of stuff!

>Pristine Wood
Can be acquired by chopping down trees and looting chests. Also used for a lot of stuff!

>Pristine Leather
One of the most important items you can obtain. You can find Pristine Leather in Myrkheim chests, Dungeon chests or craft from Leather Scraps.

>Leather Scraps
Can be obtained by slaying passive mobs. The Leatherworker in 
Origin can craft these into Pristine Leather for a low price.

>Meteor Shards
Meteor Shards are found rarely by mining Gravel in Myrkheim. They are used in the creation of Mythril and Steel Ingots, some of the strongest metals in BlockGame.

>Zombie Leather
Can be obtained by smelting Rotten Flesh in a furnace. Very important to create Necronomicons and very useful due to it being an alternative to Pristine Leather in some crafting recipes. Unfortunately there's not much to do about the smell though.

>Salt
Can be found by digging up sand. Used in many food recipes.

>Pepper
Can be obtained by breaking Vines. Jungle Biomes are great for this.

>Butter
Can be obtained by milking a cow (yes, with
a bucket) in Myrkheim and taking the milk to the chef.

>Ginger
Found by digging up Dirt. Used mostly for leveling up Archaeology-related items.

>Tough Roots
Can be most commonly obtained through
digging up dirt, mud or logging mangrove roots (also applies to the muddy variant).

>Paper
6x Bamboo in a crafting table as if you'd make a door.

>Book
Same recipe as vanilla, but with Pristine Leather.
>Shells
The shells are all used for leveling up Archeology gear and all can be found by digging up sand.

>Coagulated Mass
The Coagulated Mass is found by digging up red sand which is found in Badlands biomes rarely in Myrkheim.
>Animated Bone
This is the first important item for discovering dungeons on your own. Drops from Skeletons (rare) and can be crafted at the Alchemist.

>Lobster Souls
Can be obtained by exploring dungeons, specifically by clearing boss rooms.
>Bacon Bits
Another dungeon important item. They drop from enemies of the second dungeon.

>Cursed Sand
As of writing this book, it is currently unobtainable.

>Corrupted Items
Can be acquired by slaying mobs and 
clearing dungeons. Drops upon death.

If you're wearing a full T1 set and replace one piece with a Corrupted T1+ armor piece, you'll still receive the full set bonus! However, be careful: these items drop upon death.



===================
     -Professions-
===================
There are currently 7 professions that can be leveled up by doing different things. Mining, Fishing, Logging, Archaeology, Herbalism, Cooking and Runecarving. 
You also have a class: Einhenjar - which can be leveled up by
looting chests in Myrkheim, clearing dungeons and everything else that gives you regular XP.

>Mining 
Leveled up from breaking blocks you use your pickaxe on.

>Fishing
Leveled by getting feeesh. You can get
various types of loot too.

>Logging
Can be leved up by chopping down trees.

>Archaeology
Leveled by breaking blocks that are broken faster with a shovel.


>Herbalism 
Leveled by breaking most plant-like things.

>Cooking 
Leveled by creating recipes provided by the Chefs in Origin.

>Runecarving can be leveled up by creating runes. More about it in it's own section.

===================
  -Finding Essence-
===================
You probably noticed while checking in with the townspeople that they need a lot of essence for higher level gear, but how do you get essence?


Allow us to explain...

>Fiery Essence
Fiery Essence is dropped by anything that gives you mining EXP in Myrkheim. Fiery essence is used for a lot of things so it's important to get this!

>Damp Essence
Damp Essence is obtained through fishing directly and by trading Wetfish.
>Rocky Essence
Can be obtained by any shovelables, such as dirt and sand. Basically anything that would give you Archeology EXP.

>Fleeting Essence
You can get Fleeting Essence by chopping down trees, even the ones you grow yourself!
>Vibrant Essence
Vibrant Essence is gained through anything that would give you Herbalism XP, like crops, flowers, vines, bamboo, etc.

>Corrupted Essence
You can obtain corrupted essence by right clicking Corrupted Items with your Salvage Kit.
===================
   -Dungeons 101-
===================
One of your main goals in this world should be to conquer the various dungeons spread across Midgard. 
This section will detail how to find them and how you should prepare in order to take them on.
First of all, where do you even find these dungeons?

As mentioned previously they can be found all throughout Midgard, however discovering where they are is the tricky part. That is what the Hunter is for. By purchasing raid supplies from him
in Origin, you can obtain a compass that will tell you where the dungeon is. Although, just because you know where a dungeon is, doesn't mean you should rush headfirst into it. First, you should obtain some gear.
Before attempting your first dungeon you should at least 
have the following:
>One ranged weapon (Magic tome or Bow, both if you wish)

>A Stone Sword

>Tier 2 gear for your preferred attack method (you can use
Tier 1 gear if you're in a group). DO NOT use corrupt gear in your first few runs
because you WILL die. And as you know, Corrupted Items drops upon death.
Having to go through the dungeon to reach your party members again without any gear is very dangerous.

>Courage and an adventurous spirit. Fortune favors the bold.
===================
    -Making Money-
===================
They say money makes the world go round, and while this one may be made of cubes, the same principle still applies. 
You need money for things like crafting, ranking up, and claiming land, but how do you get it?
The main money making methods include:

>Exploring Myrkheim
Chests in Myrkheim contain a bountiful amount of coin, generally about 100 per chest. Don't worry about other people getting to the chests first, each chest has inventory on a per-player basis so 
everyone can get some rewards from it!

>Raiding Dungeons
Dungeons contain many lootable chests as well (though most of them are hiding in little nooks and crannies so keep an eye out and your exploring cap on!)


>Daily Quests
You can get a Daily Quest Token from the chest next to the town hall in Origin. You can turn in these tokens to several townsfolk to receive quests. Completing quests gives you 500 coin each and a lot of EXP for whatever category of quest you completed.
>Auction House (/ah)
The auction house is a great place to make money and get resources. You can sell items on the auction house for however much you think they're worth.
It's truly a good way to trade with others, although there's no guarantee people will buy your stuff.
>PVP
Defeating another player in combat will cause them to drop 5% of their current account balance. This may be worth it to you, however be careful! If you bully the wrong player, you may wake up with a bounty on your head!


===================
   -Tool Durability-
===================
You may notice that your tools start to break if you use them too much, but don't worry! If one of your tools breaks you can fix it by using repair powder. You can make repair powder by talking to each of the profession townsfolkin Origin's town hall, as well as by talking to the Smith, who can transform essences into repair powder.

Important to note is that it's better, cheaper and easier to craft new tools while you are at the Tier 1 and Tier 2 level, while saving repair powder for Tier 3 and highertools. This is because it's easy to collect the Tier 2 materials quickly while Tier 3 and higher requires much more investment and is therefore better to repair.






===================
    -The Atlas Inn-
      Introduction
===================
You can visit The Atlas Inn (497, -1928) by using the command '/t spawn the_atlas' and heading left. There's a bunch of useful information in there but getting a room here is very helpful early on (wasto me - cheddar) because it allows you to have a safe place to store your stuff and the town provides you with free resources such as Lava Buckets and Obsidian to get back from Myrkheim. 
To join The Atlas, the easiest way is to go to the Pirate Software discord and search 
"The Atlas - A Newbie Friendly Town". This is a thread in the #blockgame-forums and upon requesting, someone will promptly respond to you and help you get a room at the Inn. 

I've scooped up the following text from a book that can be found in the Atlas Inn.
===================
    -The Atlas Inn-
 Welcome to The Atlas
===================
Welcome to The Atlas Inn!

This is an Inn built mainly for new players to have a spot where to safely store their stuff while they figure out how this server works,
and what they want to do. Like everywhere there's rules and stuff to know:

1. For being a resident of The Atlas, there is a daily tax of 10$ a day (daily quests give you 500$)

2. You'll have one room, but you can at any time move out to
any other town, create your own, or even buy and own your plot here (more in the next section).

3. There is a community farm heading downtown with various crops for basic food on the lowest floor (replant or else). There is a nation shop in
Evermore where you can buy materials for a cheaper price. 
Make sure to interact with your nation/town members :>

4, If you go offline for a month (as an Inn resident) I (Mr. Escudero) will store your stuff in a private chest indefinetly. If you
come back your stuff will be waiting you there at the attic of the Scouting Guild, in chests to your name and only you will be able to open them.

Remember that you can tp back here with /t spawn

You can also check out higher ranks with
/ranks to get useful QoL commands (and a backpack)

The town itself is always in expansion, Atlas is forever growing!

That's about it, if you have any questions most people in the server are up to help but if it's something 
specifically related to The Atlas town and I'm not online, you can search for me in the PirateSoftware discord server (same username as here, Mr.Escudero)
===================

Check out the other books which contain valuable information at the Atlas Inn! :)
===================
   -Creating a Town-
===================
Towns and communities are super important in Blockgame. They are your home base and the only place you can safely store items. Towns can only be made and found in Midgard.


>/towny map hud
Enables a hud that
allows you to see nearby towns and available land to create your own town.

>/t create [name]
Creates your own town. You must have enough money in your balance to pay $250 upfront and there's an upkeep cost of $50
per day. Be careful as running out of money in the town's bank will cause it to go into ruin!

/t deposit [amount]
Deposits money in your town's bank.

>/t bankhistory
View your town's funds.

>/t claim
Expand your town into nearby chunks

You can claim up to 9 chunks and 1 outpost plot before you need to buy a writ of expansion.





===================
     -Runecarving-
===================
A profession that can be leveled up by crafting runes with Stonebeard in Origin. Runes can be slotted in your gear to buff their stats, but should only be seeked in higher levels. We will sum up what each rune does briefly.
>Serenity Runes buffs defensive stats.

>Clarity Runes buffs profession XP gains.

>Violence Runes buffs your offensive stats.

>Muddled Runes buffs rANdOm stats.

>Martyr Runes casts
Grand Heal on your
party upon death. 

>Backstab Runes give backstabbing damage.

>Murder Runes buffs PVP damage, but you wouldn't kill another person...

... would you?

  -Author's Remarks-
      superluigi83
===================

Hi, thanks for reading the whole book, or just skipping to the end or whatever. I think Blockgame is really neat, though somewhat cryptic, and I hope this book has helped you get into it.This ended up being way longer than I thought it would*, and I'm sorry if it's a bit wordy but I wanted this to be a bit more comprehensive than the previous one. 
If you're struggling to find some items or want to return this

[*wait til she sees Vol. 2 lol -cheddar]
book come to my Bazaar plot! You can find it by doing 
/warp Bazaar and going to the coordinates:
X: 120, Y: 37, Z: -82

but anyway that's it from me. I hope you have fun and thank you for reading! :D

  -Author's Remarks-
       cheddargt
===================
Hello!! Thank for reading the second volume of BlockGame Guide. I've put a lot of effort into this because as much as I love the wiki, I don't really like having to go out of the game in order to seek info.
superluigi83's guide has helped me A LOT in my introduction to BlockGame and I wanted to pass this on to the next wave of players.
If you need to reach me, you can find me in Pirate Software discord: @cheddargt or stop by my Café in the North-West part of The Atlas!
This took quite a bit to rewrite, so thank you for your attention! :) 

Special thanks to yoerio for revision help!



I hope we helped you in your first steps here in BlockGame!
