Hey! Are you playing in vanilla minecraft?
Well let me tell you about the Quality of Life Official blockgame mod!

It's called Enchanced Blockgame and you can find it in Modrinth, the minecraft mods page. Forget about using commands and use keybinds now!
I also really recommend getting Xaero's minimap's mod so you can mark interesing places in Myrk and never get lost again.

Other QoL mods are allowed, make sure to read the discord channel in PirateSofware's server called
#blockgame-modders to see what people recommend and what isn't allowed n such.

If you never modded minecraft don't be afraid and read installation guides carefully, also make sure to install dependencies or the mods wont work-
