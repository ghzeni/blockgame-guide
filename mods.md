*Additional info about each mod below*

### BlockGame Enhanced
This is the official mod for the BlockGame server.

### BlockGame Journal
This is an unofficial mod created by bnjc and keeps track of NPC recipes you've inspected.

### BlockGame Profiles
Swap between attributes and save them in separate profiles.

### BlockGame Tooltips
Advanced, more detailed tooltips for BlockGame items!

### Xaero's Minimap and World Map
Adds a world map and minimap to your Minecraft. It's ok to use any version of this because the server will override anything that would give you an unfair advantage over other players.

### Jade
This adds item information to what you're looking at and player/item names on top of items. Helped me a lot when I was trying to learn the name of stuff, but if you find it annoying you can disable it in Modrinth :slight_smile: 

### Keybinds Gallore Plus
Opens a pie menu when a key bound to multiple actions is pressed. Very useful for creating menus for similar functionalities :slight_smile:

### Chat Binds
This one, in addition to Keybinds Gallore, allows you to bind multiple teleport commands to a single key, so that constantly visiting different towns becomes as easy as holding down a button and releasing it!

### Chat Calc
A very simple-straightforward mod that turns your chat into a calculator! Just type in any maths and the result will appear as a pop-up. Very useful for calculating those pesky essence prices!

### Zoomify
Adds Zoom and Cinematic Zoom to your game. Very useful and very pretty.

### Mod Menu
Lets you access each mods' configuration section by adding a "Mods" button to your main menu.

### Complementary Shaders - Unbound
Shaders are pretty. You can enable/disable this by heading over to Options > Video settings > Shader Packs...

If you want a more 'Minecraft vibe' to your shaders, you can also swap out Complementary Shaders - Unbound for Complementary Shaders - Reimagined. Modrinth makes super easy to manage and swap out mods.
