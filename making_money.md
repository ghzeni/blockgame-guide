    -Making Money-
===================
They say money makes the world go round, and while this one may be made of cubes, the same principle still applies. 
You need money for things like crafting, ranking up, and claiming land, but how do you get it?
The main money making methods include:

>Exploring Myrkheim
Chests in Myrkheim contain a bountiful amount of coin, generally about 100 per chest. Don't worry about other people getting to the chests first, each chest has inventory on a per-player basis so 
everyone can get some rewards from it!

>Raiding Dungeons
Dungeons contain many lootable chests as well (though most of them are hiding in little nooks and crannies so keep an eye out and your exploring cap on!)


>Daily Quests
You can get a Daily Quest Token from the chest next to the town hall in Origin. You can turn in these tokens to several townsfolk to receive quests. Completing quests gives you 500 coin each and a lot of EXP for whatever category of quest you completed.
>Auction House (/ah)
The auction house is a great place to make money and get resources. You can sell items on the auction house for however much you think they're worth.
It's truly a good way to trade with others, although there's no guarantee people will buy your stuff.
>PVP
Defeating another player in combat will cause them to drop 5% of their current account balance. This may be worth it to you, however be careful! If you bully the wrong player, you may wake up with a bounty on your head!
