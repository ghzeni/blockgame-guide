You want to go out into the world and make your own town?
___________________

You decided to leave The Atlas, you're not a newbie anymore, congrats!

Here's the basics of what you need to know about making towns:
- Find a suitable spot for your town! Run around Midgard and make sure to do
/towny map big
to check if there's any other town's nearby.

General rule is that if you see any town at all, you're too close. If you're willing to join the nation of
Nevermore, you can found a town near other Nevermorian towns, just don't claim right next to an ally.

If you're too close you might get sieged by a nation, which means they'll take your war supplies that a town generates every day, and they're used to make powerful runes.













- You need to leave The Atlas town first. You won't lose access to your chests but you won't be able to "switch" doors open so, keep it open!

 (If I'm online I can do it but, yeah, maybe I'm not)

Leave town with
/t leave
- Once you have your new spot and have left The Atlas, go to your very first chunk you'll claim and do
/t create [name]
to create your town!

You can claim up to 9 more plots (spending 500$ from the town's bank) without raising the upkeep cost.

- Add money to your town's bank with /deposit so you can claim extra plots and make sure there is enough leftover to pay for the upkeep for at least a week in case you go offline for long!

If town's cannot pay their upeek they will go into ruin, also
called debt. You can reclaim your ruined town if you gain the money due with
/t reclaim

If debt reaches the cap, your town will be deleted!! This means anyone takes dibs on your stuff and your chests will be UNLOCKED, for everyone! 
Make sure to pay your bills, play for yourself or for the people, do as you wish, and have fun!

Thanks for reading and if you plan on making a town for people to live in, please check the official Towny documentation (google it) because
goddamn is it confusing.

Good luck!
