You moved in! What next?
___________________

After you've chosen your room and stored your valuables, you should go talk to every NPC in Origin if you haven't already, and keep getting resources from Myrk!
But what about here in Midgard?If you decide to eventually move out and make your own town, there's no hard feelings, but read the book right behind you called "Want to make your own town?" first.

Before you think of next steps, make sure you explored the server and learnt the basics, you maybedied a few times in Myrk even, crafted your very first class armor and weapons...

Done that? Yeah? Okay you can keep reading.

You can rent a plot for an extra 20$/day after claiming a plot of your choice for 50$.
Simply run around town and find a free spot of your liking, it's those deepslate squares on the floor with nothing in them.

If when walking in it says "For sale", do /plot claim and it will be yours!



Sometimes accidents happen and you forgot to have enough money in your bank, and lose your plot, oh no!

That's fine, the plot won't get deleted and your chests will stay private. I will try to reach you out on Discord and let you know if this happens,
but if you do stop playing and won't come back, please let the Mayor (Mr_Escudero) or the Assistant (GiocArt) know and we will promptly clear your plot after you run out of money :>

Now keep reading the book about plots right behind you to know more if you do want toclaim a plot, and have fun!
