   -Getting Started-
===================
Begin your quest by visiting Midgard. Then in the town of Origin, make sure to acquaint yourself with the locals.
Tools and gear are not made the traditional way in this world and require the help of the townsfolkin order to create them.
The craftsmen who stick to their stations around town will generally be the ones to create tools and other things, while those who stay in the town hall will create repair powder for you (with the exception of the runecarver see p45).Make sure to familiarize yourself with what you need to craft things and then head to Myrkheim to collect those items!

(NOTE: you can only return from Myrkheim by using a Nether Portal. Be careful!)



===================
-Important Mechanics-
===================

Blockgame has several mechanics that are different from base Minecraft that you should be aware of read carefully!

>Hunger and Thirst
Though hunger is invanilla Minecraft, Blockgame makes eating much more rewarding and punishing to keep up on. 

Failing to feed yourself will inevitably result in your death so make sure to have some snacks ready!

On the flipside, being fully fed will give you a small buff, improving your EXP gain and movement speed while fully fed. However, just eating normal foods won't keep you fed for long, which is why you need to worry about Hydration as well.

Hydration is basically a second hunger baron top of your normal hunger bar which will be eaten through first before your main hunger bar is, allowing you to keep your fully fed buff longer.

>Professions
There are 6 main professions in Blockgame that can be leveled up by doing things in Myrkheim.
These are Mining, Fishing, Logging, Archeology, Herbalism, and Einherjar.

Mining is leveled up from breaking blocks you use your pickaxe on.

Fishing is leveled by well, fishing.

Logging is leved up bychopping down trees.

Archeology is leveled by breaking blocks that are broken faster with a shovel.

Herbalism is leveled by breaking most plant-like things.

Einherjar is leveled up by finding chests in Myrkheim and slayinmonsters pretty much everywhere.

There is a 7th profession called Runecarving but we will touch on that in its own section.






===================
  -Finding Essence-
===================

You probably noticed while checking in with the townspeople that they need a lot of essence for higher level gear, but where do you get that essence?

Allow me to explain...>Fiery Essence
Fiery Essence is dropped by anything that gives you mining EXP in Myrkheim. Fiery essence is used for a lot of things so it's important to get this!

>Damp Essence
Damp Essence is obtained through fishing.

>Rocky Essence
Rocky Essence is obtained through anything that would give you Archeology EXP so basically any shovelables.

>Fleeting Essence
You can find Fleeting Essence simply by chopping down trees. (Even the ones you grow yourself!)
>Vibrant Essence
Vibrant Essence is gained through anything that would give you Herbalism EXP, such as crops, vines, sugarcane, and bamboo.

>Corrupted Essence
Corrupted Essence is a tricky one because it is not obtained through a traditional
stat. You instead obtain corrupted essence by right clicking items with the "Corrupted" prefix on them with your Salvage Kit. 
While Corrupted items can be more powerful than what you already have they do drop on death so turning them into essence may be for the best. 
===================
-Uncommon  Materials-
===================

While looking at the crafting recipes from the townspeople of Origin, you may have noticed that they need some materials that aren't in vanilla Minecraft. But where do you get these?
Allow me to explain...>Meteor Shards
Meteor Shards are pretty important to progression. They are used in the creation of Mythril and Steel Ingots.
Meteor Shards are found rarely by mining gravel in Myrkheim.

>Zombie Leather
Rotten Flesh is not useless in this land,
putting it in a furnace and smelting it will allow you to obtian Zombie Leather, which is used to create Necronomicons as well as an alternative to Pristine Leather in some recipes.

>Pristine Leather
This is probably one of the most important items you can obtain,
and while easy to get it can be just as easy to run out.
You can either find Pristine Leather in Myrkheim chests or by obtaining Leather Scraps (from passive mobs) which you give to the Leatherworker to make the Leather.

>Pristine Wood
Pristine Wood is easyto obtain. Just chop down trees and you're bound to get some.

>Pristine Stone
Gathering Pristine Stone is similar to gathering Pristine Wood, only you instead mine stone-like objects. 
Pristine Stone is used for T2 tools and Runecarving.
>Salt
Salt is used in many advanced food recipes, and can be found by digging up sand.

>Pepper
Pepper is also used in some advanced food recipes, but is found by breaking vines specifically.

>Ginger
Ginger is mostly used for leveling up Archeology tools and it is found by digging up dirt.

>Butter
Butter is obtained how you think it is, but if you don't know, you make it by putting a milk bucket in your crafting area.
>Tough Roots
Tough Roots are also used for leveling up Archeology tools and can be obtained through digging up dirt as well.

>Shells
The shells are all used for leveling up Archeology gear and all can be found by digging up sand.
>Coagulated Mass
The Coagulated Mass is found by digging up red sand which is found in Badlands biomes rarely in Myrkheim.

>Animated Bone
This is the first important item for discovering dungeons on your own. You can obtain them as rare
drops from Skeletons, but also you can craft them at the Alchemist.

>Lobster Souls
Lobster Souls are the second in the chain of dungeon finding items, though they are used for other things as well. They can be found rarely while fishing, or by beatingbosses in the first dungeon.

>Bacon Bits
Bacon Bits are another dungeon important item, they are only dropped by the enemies of the second dungeon.

>Cursed Sand
This is another dungeon important item however, as of writing this book it is currently unobtainable, however they will most likely drop from enemies in the third dungeon.







===================
 Discovering Dungeons
===================

One of your main goals in this world should be to conquer the various dungeons spread across Midgard. This section will detail how to find them and how you should prepare in order to take them on.First of all, where do you even find these dungeons?

As mentioned previously they can be found all throughout Midgard, however discovering where they are is the tricky part. That is what the Hunter is for. By purchasing raid supplies from theHunter in Origin, you can obtain a compass that will tell you where the dungeon is.

Although, just because you know where a dungeon is, doesn't mean you should rush headfirst into it. First, you should obtain some gear.

Before attempting your first dungeon you should at least have the following:

>At least one ranged weapon (Magic tome or Bow, both if you wish)

>A Stone Sword

>Tier 2 gear for your preferred attack method (You can useTier 1 gear if in a group)

>Food (duh)

>An adventurous spirit

It is also recommoned that you reach at least Level 15 in Einherjar before taking on the first dungeon solo and Lvl9/10 if in a group.

For traversing the second dungeon, you want the following:

>Tier 3/4 ranged weapon(s)

>Tier 3/4 sword

>Tier 3/4 armor

>Food
>A brave heart

The recommended level for soloing dungeon 2 is around 50, though with a party you should each be fine at level 30 or so. Obtaining Tier 3 and 4 crafting recipes from the auction house may be crutial for survival.

===================
    -Making Money-
===================

They say money makes the world go round, and while this one may be made of cubes, the same principle still applies. You need money for things like crafting, ranking up, and claiming land, but how do you get it?The main money making methods include:

-Exploring Myrkheim
Chests in Myrkheim contain a bountiful amount of coin, generally about 100 per chest. Don't worry about other people getting to the chests first, each chest has inventory on a per-player basis so
everyone can get some rewards from it!

-Raiding Dungeons
Dungeons contain many lootable chests as well (though most of them are hiding in little nooks and crannies so keep an eye out and your explorin cap on!)

-Daily Quests
You can get a Daily Quest Token from a chest next to the front door of town hall. You can turn in these tokens to recieve quests from the mayor. Completing quests gives you 500 coin each and a lot of EXP for whatever category of quest you completed.
-Auction House (/ah)
The auction house is a great place to make money and get resources. You can sell items on the auction house for however much you think they're worth.
It's truly a good way to trade with others, although there's no guarantee people will buy your stuff.-PVP
Defeating another player in combat will cause them to drop 5% of their current account balance. This may be worth it to you, however be careful! If you bully the wrong player, you may wake up with a bounty on your head!


-Claiming Bounties
If someone is causing problems for another, they may put a bounty on their head. Killing the player with the bounty on their head will allow you to claim their bounty, adding the bounty's price to your pockets.



===================
     -Runecarving-
===================

Runecarving is a special skill that you can only level up by crafting runes with Stonebeard in the Origin town hall. 

Runes can be slotted in your gear in order to upgrade their statsEach rune has its own function:

-Serenity Runes
These improve your defensive stats, like Health, Defense, and Blocking Rate.

-Clarity Runes
Clarity Runes improve your EXP gain for your professions.

-Violence Runes
As expected, violence increases your offensive stats, such as Melee, Projectile, and Magic damage.

-Muddled Runes
These are completely rANdOm and give random stats from the previously mentioned runes.

-Martyr Runes
As foretold, a Martyr is one to be sacrificed. When someone with a Martyr rune is killed Grand Heal is cast on their party, healing them so they can keep fighting for their fallen ally.

-Backstab Runes
Increases your backstabbing damage.-Adrenaline Rune
This powerful rune requires a 100 in runecarving, and what it does is grant you Speed 1 upon killing another creature.

-Murder Runes
Increases PVP damage but you wouldn't kill another person...
would you?

Most runes require essence to craft so this is generally something you should start investing in later on.
Armor that increases your runecarving stats can also be purchased from a Runecarver in the back of Origin.


===================
    -Tool Durability-
===================

You may notice that your tools start to break if you use them too much, but don't worry! If one of your tools breaks you can fix it by using repair powder.
You can make repair powder by talking to each of the profession townsfolk in Origin's town hall, as well as by talking to the Smith, who can transform essences into repair powder.

Important to note is that it's probably better and easier to craft new tools while
you are at the Tier 1 and Tier 2 level, while saving repair powder for Tier 3 and higher tools. This is because it's easy to collect the Tier 2 materials quickly while Tier 3 and higher requires much more investment and is therefore better to repair.


===================
    -Getting a Town-
===================

Towns and communities are super important in Blockgame. They are your home base and the only place you can safely store items.
Towns can only be made and found in Midgard.In order to get a town you can either ask someone if you can join theirs, or create your own!

You can create your town with the following command:
/t create [name]
(Note: you must have enough money in your balance to create a town)
After that you have to pay an upkeep cost of $50 each day, which comes out of your town's bank.

To keep money in your town's bank use the following command:
/t deposit [amount]

Then view your town's funds using:
/t bankhistory
You can claim more chunks for your town by going to a nearby chunk and using:
/t claim

You can claim up to 9 chunks and 1 outpost plot before you need to buy a writ of expansion.



===================
      -Helpful Tips-
===================

>Start with Mining
Mining is probably the single most important tool for getting things in Blockgame. Leveling up your Mining tools as fast as possible will allow you to get more materials than any other skill.Mining also gets you Fiery Essence which is very important to a lot of things.

>Spec into Magic as soon as possible.
Magic skills are very powerful and having a ranged attack is important. My advice would be trying to get Firebolt II, but any spell helps.
>Use Community Farms
The farms in Origin are useful for getting food easily. Take whatever you need, but make sure to replant! Those who fail to replant are known to get bounties on their heads...

>Buy Armor and Accessories from vendors.Armors and accessories improve the stats and exp gain of the profession that they're for. The higher your profession skill, the more essences you get!

>Get a bucket fast!
You can only leave Myrkheim through nether portals!
Therefore having a way to make a portal as fast as possible is important. You can use a bucket to put lava in a water area to make the shape, and water buckets in general are useful. There are always portals at X;0,Y:0,Z:0 in Myrkheim but there may be someone lying in wait for you there...
>Check the Wiki!
This book may be in depth for now but as things get added it may change. And there are some things I didn't mention! Check out the wiki here:
https://blockgame.piratesoftware.wiki/wiki/Main_Page



>Talk to others.
Blockgame is a Social Sandbox MMO, so one of the most important parts is being social!
Don't be afraid to ask for help in whatever way you need. Who knows? You might make a great friend.

>Make sure to rank up!
Use /ranks to buy
ranks in order to get your backpack as fast as you can! Your backpack is an extra inventory area which even keeps items labeled "Drops on Death" when you die!

>Have fun!
(duh)



===================
  -Author's Remarks-
===================

Hi, thanks for reading the whole book, or just skipping to the end or whatever. I think Blockgame is really neat, though somewhat cryptic, and I hope this book has helped you get into it.This ended up being way longer than I thought it would, and I'm sorry if it's a bit wordy but I wanted this to be a bit more comprehensive than the previous one.

 If you're struggling to find some items or want to return this book, come to my Bazaar plot! You can
find it by doing 
/warp Bazaar

and going to the coordinates:
X: 120, Y: 37, Z: -82

but anyway that's it from me. I hope you have fun and thank you for reading!
:D
