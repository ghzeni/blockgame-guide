You decided to stay?
___________________

Either because you don't like building but need the hoarding space, or because you can't be bothered, or whatever reason, you decided to stay here, congrats! 

This is all you need to know about plots:- Go around town, plots which can be bought are marked with a sign "FOR SALE", and choose yours!

- Stand in it and type /plot claim
The plot costs 50$ to claim, and your daily tax will go from 10$ to 30$/day


- Now you can build whatever you want within the chunk limits, congrats!!

There are only a few guidelines to follow when building:

One is to keep some kind of border marker. You can destroy the deepslate border but at least
replace it with some kind of "border". Even something as simple as a lantern in every corner works! This is more so your neighbours have a clear idea on where their own limits are as well.

Second is to try not to lose your plot by not having enough
money to pay rent. If you ever lose your plot, please refer to the book in the Scouting guild about this exact scenario.

Third is to not overuse glowing blocks. I personally like glowing blocks a lot but we can all agree that an exterior wall of just
glowstone is a bit much. Most people play with shaders and light blocks glow a LOT.

Other than that, you're free to do whatever you want, any theme, any aesthetic. Residents have taken a liking to keep the aesthetic the same but I as a mayor, don't want to hold 
your creativity back.

If you need any build materials please let any staff member know, or ask to any nation member, or resident! I'm sure they'd love to help.





Now go on, show me what you can build >:)

===================

Do you want an apartment instead? Then let a staff member know to which apartment and flat you want to move and they will help you relocate. Your rent will stay the same!
